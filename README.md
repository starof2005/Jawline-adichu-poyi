Project Description
Jawline Adich Poyi is an IoT-based system that tracks a cow’s chewing using an MPU6050 sensor on an ESP32 and detects nearby humans with an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. The data is sent to Firebase and displayed on a fun, animated web dashboard that shows the cow’s mood, plays videos, and updates live chewing stats

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Nobody hears what a cow says when we go near it… and nobody knows its mood while chewing.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We attached motion and distance sensors to the cow’s head, tracked chewing patterns, streamed data to Firebase, and made a fun website to announce the cow’s mood and play cheeky videos when you approach.

Diagrams
Data flow: Sensors → ESP32 → Firebase → Web Dashboard.
Sensors capture chewing & motion → ESP32 processes & sends to Firebase → Web dashboard displays mood, videos, and stats in real time.

For Hardware:

Schematic & Circuit
MPU6050
VCC → 3.3V
GND → GND
SDA → GPIO 21 (SDA)
SCL → GPIO 22 (SCL)

HC-SR04 Ultrasonic
VCC → 5V (or 3.3V if you prefer; 5V gives best range)
GND → GND
TRIG → GPIO 33 (digital out from ESP32)
ECHO → Voltage divider → GPIO 32 (digital input to ESP32)

Voltage divider for ECHO (if HC-SR04 powered at 5V)
Convert ECHO 5V → 3.3V safe for ESP32:

ECHO output → R1 = 2.2kΩ → node → R2 = 3.3kΩ → GND
(Take the node between R1 and R2 to ESP32 GPIO32).
— This divides ~5V down to ~3.0–3.2V which is safe for ESP32 input.
Alternatively use R1 = 1.8kΩ and R2 = 3.3kΩ (≈3.3V at node).
